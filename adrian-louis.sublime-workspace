We were playing with the red rope in the turf room, and I have him a swing, but he didn't land on his feet, he came down on his side\n\nOoh!  :( Poor puppy!  Is he ok?\n\nHe yelled a lot when it happened and limped for a while after, but he seems to be up to 98% now. He's running on the leg that hurt, though from time to time I'll see him baby it a little\n\nAww. Well at least he's doing good. He might just have a puppy bruise.\n\nI gave him a chewie and he he ran around like a madman\n\nHe's whining it a bit while he's chewing it, but that may be related to the chew\n\nWhat a trooper. :)\n\nIdk... I gotta keep an eye on him\n\nI worry\n\nI'd do the same for sure. You're his human, of course you want him to be safe and ok :)\n\nI feel just awful :(\n\nI had to take the chewie away because he's being very whiny with it\n\nAnd I'm not sure if he's okay\n\n:(. Can you call the vet and see if he should come in? I think just keeping an eye out like you're doing is great. I'm sure he's okay love :)\n\nI'll hold off for now. He doesn't seem to be showing any signs of dramatic injury\n\nThat sounds like a good plan :).\n1/11/16, 12:15 PM\n\nHow's Remi monster?\n\nHe's still babying his leg a little bit, but he's not in pain and he seems to have walked it off for the most part\n\nPoor guy. No more swings, that's for sure\n\nAt least not that high up\n\nThat's good to hear :). Haha, no high swings sounds like a good thing :)\n\nHow's your day otherwise?\n\n\nIMG_4064\n\n\nIt's not too bad. Working on onboaridng\n\nWhat a lil' blanket thief. ;) \n\nThat doesn't sound too bad at all :)\n\nHaha and if you look closely, you'll see he's got a blanket boner\n\nHahahaha!!!!  OMG!  He does. Funny\n\nCool with Wednesday instead of Tuesday for the Lego busting night?\n\nOf course. :)  still planning on just a guys night?\n\nNope, everybody\n\nApplication submitted\n\nCoolio!  I think that sounds like a blast!  Thanks for dropping the app off for me :)\n\nDid they say anything about time frame or anything?\n\nNope\n\nShouldn't be too long\n\nKk. What are your plans this evening?\n\nWell, we could go to the mall, get sushi and Legos\n\nOoh. That we could :)\n\nI have a few things I want to do after work and then I'll be home\n\nOkay coolio\n1/11/16, 4:28 PM\n\nAre you okay if the guys all hang out here the whole weekend of Winterfest? Weekend of February 26\n\nYeah, of course that's fine. :)  \n\nCool cool!\n\nAwesome, thanks!\n\nWhoops, that was meant for Jeff\n\nIs the door unlocked?  I'll be home soon ;)\n\nYep\n1/11/16, 11:09 PM\n\n\nIMG_2611\n\n\nLol they'd be able to take those Stormtroopers down easy\niMessage with 17014910168\n12/17/15, 12:26 PM\n\nPurple couch?  How is the little Remi monster today?  \n\nAnd yes!  It was terrible and I did fall asleep. Haha!!  How's your day so far my love?\n\nHahaha sorry it was terrible, but good morning :)\n\n\nIMG_5311\n\n\nHe's jus chillin :)\n12/17/15, 4:14 PM\n\nHe's sooo long!  Haha. Such a cutie :)\n\nThe line at the post office is insane!!!  Damn my need for stamps.\n\nOh yeah? I got your stamps right here!\n\nIs that so?  Oh you ;). If only that was really true & I could leave this line. Haha. ;)\n\nNope, you'll be there for hours\n\nBahaha. Says you!  I just left. ;). 13 stamps and 26 minutes\n\nWell then\n\nPoo\n\n;) I love you\n\nI love you too, baby girl  :)\n\nI saw this today and I have to share. It made me giggle and think of Remi monster...\n\n\nIMG_2428\n\n\nD'awwww!!! He's so adorable!!! And he will!!!\n12/17/15, 6:34 PM\n\nRemi just had his first successful trip to the indoor poop room :)\n\nYay!!!!  It's cold af and getting colder. This will make things sooo much easier for his humans.\n12/17/15, 7:42 PM\n\nHow's your night going handsome?\n\nIt's not bad. I kinda slacked off this morning, so I'm working late to finish up some work\n\nYours?\n\nAh. I gotcha. That doesn't sound too bad at all. :)\n\nWashing my dress for tomorrow and watching a movie in the living room. Enjoying another quiet night of being home alone.\n\nI miss you like crazy!\n\nI miss you too! Can't wait until we jam to the Sound of Music tomorrow night!!!!\n\nMe neither :). I'm very excited!!\n\nI'm done at 4. Depending on traffic I'll be home around 4:30. My plan is to get ready for the theatre ( read in a haughty accent with your pinky up), pack a few things for the weekend, and head over. The shows at 7 so we probably need to leave by 6 at the latest to plan for traffic and parking.\n\nThough... Alternately, you could leave the key at the front desk. I'll bring my stuff to work and head to your place to get ready. Whichever works best\n\nYeah I could leave a key at the desk no prob\n\nI'll leave work at 5 and we'll be on our way once I freshen up\n\nSo much snow outside!!!!\n\nPerfect!  I'll plan for that then. I'll head straight to your place after work and get ready :)\n\nSo much snow. It's a real life snow globe :)\n\nSo peaceful! I love snow!\n\nWhen I'm not driving in it\n\nHow's your night?\n\nHaha!  So true. It's pretty, but I do have to drive in that crap. Lol\n\nMy night has been awesome!  \n\nOh yeah? Why's that?\n\nI just love having the house to myself. Feels like when I lived alone. lol\n\nHaha nice, sound fun\niMessage with 17014910168\n12/16/15, 9:16 AM\n\nThat's true. The sexy fun happens this weekend ;). Also, THUNDER!!!  In December!  😊\n\nWhat?? I didn't hear thunder?\n\nIt was really short lived.\n12/16/15, 6:38 PM\n\nHoly crap, today was busy!! But good :)\n\nHow was your day?\n\nYay!  I love busy and awesomely productive days!! :)\n\nMy day was really great but I'm pooped. I woke up waaay to early this morning. Haha\n\nWhat time did you get up?\n\nAbout 4:30. I just couldn't fall back asleep.\n\nSo what are your plans this evening?\n\nThat sucks! Not being asleep is the worst thing in the world!\n\nI decided today that besides working on the JF site, I'm taking the rest of the year off from side projects. So I'm vegging out with tv and Fallout :)\n\nYou?\n\nI know!!!  It's been that way all week sleep wise. ☹\n\nI think it sounds like you decided on an excellent plan!!  Fallout and tv vegging is a perfect hump day night activity :).\n\nI'm working on laundry, creating a packing list for Utah, and writing out Christmas cards so I can mail those out before we leave. :)\n\nOh yeah! Christmas cards!\n\nI liked your cards\n\nAww!  Thanks hon!  That means a lot 😊\n\nI got a compliment from our CEO today on some of my work\n\nReally?!!!!?  Babe, that is so awesome!!!  😃. You work so hard, that has to feel amazing!  I'm so proud of you! 😊\n\nI've got the house to myself tonight!  Love it! :)\n\nNice!! Loud Christmas movies? ;)\n\nI am proud of that compliment too :)\n\nRemi was biting at nothing and scratching, so I had a mini does-he-have-fleas freak out\n\nHe's definitely dirty from play today, but I washed him and I'm going to hope for the best\n\nUgh!  I remember having a fleas freak out with Neko. No fun!!  I bet it's just the dirty from being outside in the mid and rain.  :)\n\nAnd good!!  You should be proud! :)\n\nLoud enough on the movie front to not need captions, haha!!\n\nHe does have a couple of bumps underneath his haunches, but I'm going to assume they're nothing until I monitor him further.\n\nWhat's the movie tonight?\n\nBad Santa. Never saw this one before\n\nGood?\n\n50/50. It's abrasive comedy to be sure. But it feels abrasive for abrasive's sake. I'll have to wait until the end for a proper assessment.\n\nEntertaining enough to though\n\nOops. Minus the \"to\"\n\nHow's Fallout?\n\nReally good\n\nKillin raiders and mutants\n\nPerfect Wednesday! ;)\n\nRaiders and mutants need a good fallout apocalypse killin'. ;)\n\nI owe it to the wasteland, really\n\nNow I feel all creepy crawly\n\nHaha!  You're not all creepy crawly :)\n\nBugs make me feel that way though\n\nBugs?  Like glitches? Or super human, mutant insects?\n\nNormal insects. Like fleas\n\nAh. That I definitely get. When I freaked about Neko, I shaved his neck to deep search the skin ( he looked a miserable mini lion) and washed my bedding line 4 times. Lol\n\nWell Remi's sound asleep on the purple couch. Guess we'll wait and see\n\nHow was the movie\n\nI guess it was so bad you fell asleep ;)\n\nI love you, good night :)\niMessage with 17014910168\n12/10/15, 12:06 AM\n\nWell, I suppose it's about that time. Sleep well handsome and sweet dreams!  I love you millions Brian! 😊\n\nI love you too, babe!  Sleep tight\n12/10/15, 9:03 AM\n\nGood morning beautiful, I hope you have a great start to your day and a bright and wonderful morning (or if you're like me, you'd prefer a dark and stormy morning!)\n12/10/15, 11:51 AM\n\nGood morning to you as well sexy!  It's been a pretty great day so far!  I don't mind the dark and stormy days myself. I hope you're having a terrific day yourself!\n\nSo I’d like tonight to do a little more work on my site, and tomorrow you’ve so kindly agreed to take care of Remi.\n\nSaturday night is the scotch tasting, and Jason invited us to Surly at 4 (we can stay till 5).  And on Sunday, I’d like to take you out 😊\n12/10/15, 2:59 PM\n\nThat sounds like a great plan!  I'm looking forward to all of the things 😊. Where are you wanting to take me? ;)\n\nSomewhere nice for a good cocktail\n\nThat sounds really lovely :). You're so sweet hon! :)\n12/10/15, 6:41 PM\n\nI just had the weirdest nap\n\nOh?\n\nI doze off and woke up at like 5:40. Thought I was the morning and nearly accepted that it was time to get ready for work again. And then I saw the clock said PM. Silly embilly, haha!\n\nLol you slept for 12 hours\n\nI thought so. It was nuts. I feel weirdly, super awake now\n\nHow's your night so far?\n\nIt's okay. I fell asleep, and I still had like half an hour of work to finish up\n\nWhat?!!??!?  You mean to say we're napping buddies today?! 😱. shut the front door. Haha.\n\nIn all seriousness- that's not bad. And you're all done with the workin' for tonight!  That's great!\n\nAlso- awkward early evening naps for the WIN!!  😴🤗\n\nRight?!?! Naps are awesome except when they make you feel bad\n\nHow's your night going?\n\nAlso, what time is our flight out on Monday the 21st, and what time does the flight get in on Monday the 28th?\n\nMy night has been pretty good. Need to complete some home to-dos still but it's been good. As far as the flights I'm not sure. I will call my mom and double check. Also, I think I emailed you the flight itinerary after we booked it :)\n\nCool\n\nI only got one email and it doesn't have all the info\n\nOk. Let me look back through my emails\n\nMy mom said we want to be at the airport by 12-12:30pm on the 21st and we get back in about 8:30pm on the 28th but she didn't have the exact times on hand\n\nOkay great, thanks! Mary asked for the exact dates and times. I said I'd drop him off early on Monday, pick him up afternoon on Tuesday\n\nPlans for the night besides to-dos?\n\nThat's perfect!  :)\n\nNah, not really. I might bust out the ole' coloring book later\n\nNot too shabby, coloring is fun!\n\nNot at all :). How's your web work going?\n\nIt's alright. I got an email informing me that Divshot, the hosting solution I moved all my shit to, was acquired by Google Firebase, so I have to migrate everything again before we leave for our trip\n\nHopefully will only take ~10 minutes a site, but could be a pain in the ass for sure\n\nYikes!  Yeah, that sounds like a bit of a headache. I'll keep my fingers crossed that's a quick process.\n\nTomorrow is the office's first Fido Friday :)\n\nOoh!  Nice!!  Is Remi coming?\n\nNah, I don't think he's a very good office dog candidate\n\nToo high strung\n\nAre you sure you're cool watching him tomorrow? I feel a little bad for asking\n\nAh. I suppose that's true. :)\n\nOf course I'm sure. I wouldn't have said yes otherwise.\n\nBut if you would rather I not that's fine. I can always hang out at home and just see you Saturday afternoon. Whatever you'd like babe\n\nAs long as you're cool with it :)\n\nWith everything that's happened between James and I, it's important to me to make sure he and I get good hang time\n\nThat's great!  I think that's important too 😊. I love Remi time so I'm more than happy to help out so you guys can hang and have a good time!!\n\n\nIMG_3941\n\n\n\"Come snuggle wit meeee!!\" -Remi\n\nAwwww!!!  Heart melting cuteness!!  Tell Remi he gets all the Emily human snuggles he wants tomorrow. :)\n\nActually, I lied. Tell him he gets a lot of Emily human snuggles but that I have to save the rest for Brian human.  😉\n\nOooh we both like that news :)\n\n\"I peed in dees blankits!\" -Remi\n\nHaha!!  Eewww!  Remi!  He's so proud of that too.\n\nI want chicken\n\nChicken sounds good!  I still can't wait to try the whisky chicken of yours :)\n\nHow goes the web migration?\n\nActually I'll do that another time. Tonight I'm doing logo stuff\n\nAh, I gotcha :). That's awesome too. :)\n\nSend you my progress\n\nIt's more impressive than it seems because it's 100% code\n\nHaha. I'm sure it's more impressive than you think. ;). I'll take a look\n\nI really like how it look babe!!  I can only see one version; I think they want me to signup to fully view it. The green and white looks really slick on the black background. :)\n\nClick it\n\nNvm  doesn't work on phone\n\nAh, lol. Show me tomorrow when you get home or Saturday. :).\n\nOff to bed! Good night, my lovely ;)\n\nI was just about to say the same :). Sleep well and sweet dreams handsome!  I love you millions!!\n\nDo you want me to stay over tomorrow night?\n\nYou're always welcome to :) might make it easier to get ready and go Saturday?\n\n😊 terrific!  I was thinking the same. See you tomorrow!  G'night sexy\niMessage with 17014910168\n12/2/15, 10:18 AM\n\nI love you.\n12/2/15, 12:41 PM\n\nI love you too but my heart hurts so much right now.\n12/2/15, 7:05 PM\n\nI really do love you\n\nSo much\n\nI know babe.

So good. We should watch it sometime :). They did such an incredible job with the film\n\nIsn't that the one that you watch to make yourself cry?\n\nHaha!  Yes, it certainly makes me cry but West Side Story is my go to for that. :). Les Mis is just a gorgeous story of life, love, struggle, war, and human spirit thriving against all odds.

Not complaining about that. Haha :)\n12/8/15, 3:38 PM\n\nDid you know Shel Silverstein did music?\n\nI didn't. That's cool :). What kind of music did he do?\n\nMostly children's songs; poems, much like in his books, set to music. But also some adult albums where he sings a lot about pot and Johnny Cash\n\nHaha!  That's awesome :). I'd love to hear some some time.\n\nIt's all on Spotify. It's cool\n\nYou can tell he likes Johnny Cash a lot\n12/8/15, 6:18 PM\n\nI love you\n\nDeeply\n\nAnd truly\n\nAww :) I love you too baby!  So very much! Sweet, sexy man! 😊\n\nI miss you.

You make me smile everyday, even days I don't get to see you; you just make me so happy :)\n\nHow's your evening treating you handsome?\n\nYou make me happy too, Beautiful :)\n\nIt's good. Falling Out, probably gonna do some site work\n\nYou?\n\nThat sounds like a very enjoyable night! What site stuff are you hoping to get done?\n\nMy night has been really nice. I've done laundry and showered. Watching some Netflix and deciding on dinner but I think I might throw in some Christmas music and craft a bit. Undecided lol\n\nI guess Evi's boyfriend broke up with her, so they're going to be here drinking. I don't really feel like working all that much, so I'll probably drink with them and okay Fallout of possible. You're welcome to join me\n\nAre you sure?  I can bring some wine to share. Poor Evie. That's so shitty :(.\n\nI just need to change out of my pjs\n\nThey're out buying stuff right now, so no need to bring anything. Can you stay here tonight?\n\nRead: you're welcome to stay here tonight\n\nI work really close to home tomorrow so it may be easier to stay here. But I'll bring stuff just in case. I miss falling asleep with my love by my side 😊\n\nWhatever you need, lovely\n\nMaybe bring wine, Idk what they're buying besides tequila\n\nHaha. I can do that. Just waiting on this dryer. Should only be a little longer\n12/9/15, 9:29 AM\n\nThank you so much for your puppy care and medical attention :)  it was so thoughtful, especially when you had to be up and out so early. You're so good to me\n\nYou're very welcome!  I know you'd do the same for me :) I hope you're feeling much better!  I love you so much!\n12/9/15, 5:14 PM\n\nHow's your day been?\n\nGross, hungover, and unproductive. But not bad. Yours?\n\nBoo :(. That sucks to hear hon.\n\nMine was good overall. Just feeling super stressed at the moment\n\nWhy stressed?\n\nJust life stuff.\n\n??\n\nFeeling stretched thin and financially anxious... Especially with winter break coming up and 2 weeks of no income. Life stuff.  :/ I just need to think of a plan I suppose  \n\nPoor girl :( Don't fret, I promise you'll be okay. Specially with me around :)\n\nMy love will crush you with its awesomeness\n\nThanks baby!  You're so sweet. I want to be crushed by awesome love ;)\n\nHow's card making\n\nIt's going well so far\n\nTired?\n\nNah. Not too tired :)\n\nI'm still really touched that you let Remi out this morning. That meant a lot to me, especially because you had to get up so early\n\nDon't worry about it, I was more than happy to do it 😊 it's cuz I love you like crazy and stuff 😉😊\n\nHaha I love you like crazy and stuff too!\n\nWhat are you up too this fine evening?\n\nFallout and hopefully site stuff if I can stop being lazy\n12/9/15, 8:39 PM\n\nOh nice!  That sounds great babe!  Good Wednesday plan\n12/9/15, 9:41 PM\n\nHow's you're site work going?\n\nGood, I actually just settled in to start in on it (ps4 controller died, lol)\n\nCards?\n\nSweet :). Cards are done and I'm headed home\n\nGet em all wrapped up?\n\nYes indeed :)\n\nHave you heard more about what day you need me to Remi sit?\n\nI did - James wants to hang out Friday.  If you’re willing to watch Remi, I can go to his place so he doesn’t have to spend the gas coming here.  Otherwise, he could come here.  Either way is fine\n\nOf course I'm willing to watch the Remi monster! :). Let me know what time and I'm there\n\nThat sounds awesome!  Thanks babe!\n\nYou're most welcome!  \n\nWhat will you want for food?\n\n\nIMG_8457\n\n\nHere's the cards from tonight. We tried a new technique with the birch tree card. It was super neat\n\nOoh... Food!  Let me think on it and I'll get back to ya :)\n\nOh wow… that’s really really cool!!!\n\nHow did you make the birch trees?\n\nThanks hon!!  \n\nUsing an embossing folder and stamping ink and the tree images on the folder before placing the paper and running it through the embossing machine. So so neat\n\nYou could probably make a few bucks selling cards online\n\nI've considered that before. It's just weighing cost of materials with selling price.\n\nTrue.  How much does it cost you to make a card?\n\nIt varies depending on the paper used, embellishments, the equipment, etc...  Right now the cost is really minimal because of what I already have as well as the things I can use at my mom's. But that could change later as materials start running out\n\nBut they'd probably only sell for about $3-7 a piece depending\n\nOh I gotcha\n\nThat would definitely be a fun side project though! :)\n\nFor sure!\niMessage with 17014910168\n10/29/15, 12:01 AM\n\nYou will :)\n\nI conked out but now I'm going to bed for realsies. Sweet dreams!  I love you millions!! ☺️\n10/29/15, 9:00 AM\n\nNo worries! I love you, I hope your day is fantastic\n10/29/15, 10:39 AM\n\nI love you too!  I hope you have a terrific day as well :)\n10/29/15, 4:19 PM\n\nYou're wonderful, and you make me so happy. I can't stop thinking about you :)\n\nOh Brian!  ☺️. You're so sweet, you've got me smiling from ear to ear. Though, generally speaking, just the thought of you does that to me. I can't stop thinking about you either 😊 you are an incredible man and everyday I'm so happy that I have you in my life!  \n10/29/15, 6:02 PM\n\nHow's your evening been going?\n\nIt's been okay. End of the work day I hadn't really accomplished much. I was exhausted, so I took a 30 minute nap, and now I have a bit more energy. Gonna try on my halloween costume then I'm gonna try to get a little more work done\n\nHow's yours?\n\nThat sounds like a great plan :). I'm glad you could get a nap in. My night has been good. Besides some thrift store hunting tomorrow, my costume is done. I sewed my last piece today and I'm feeling really proud of it :). I've never sewed for a costume before. I'm super thankful for my mom's help last night.\n\nI emailed your mom about thanksgiving too :)\n\nI'm excited to see it!\n\nHey if you think of it, could you pick me up a red/maroonish bow tie? I forgot that\n\nI sure can :). I'll keep my eyes peeled tomorrow. I'll even throw in a fez ;)\n\nOoh if you think of it! :D\n\nI am going to get our Rocky Horror tickets for Saturday too so we won't have to worry about any potential crowds day of :)\n\nNice! You've got it all down!\n\nI don't have anything down. I'm 100 steps behind\n\nAww, I don't believe that. Your costume was nearly done before I started!  I'd say we're on equal footing :). I'm just going after tickets tomorrow because I'm so pumped I don't want to risk missing it. Haha!  The beer crawl starts at 7 pm Saturday and as long as we're by the theater by 11 pm I'd say we're golden. We can organize prop bags Saturday morning/ late afternoon. Get costumed and party on as the Halloween gods intended. :)\n\n* early afternoon. Oops\n\nAww you're sweet babe!\n\nOkay cool. Sounds like it's gonna be a fun weekend\n\nBecky is unofficially making Friday a bday party for Lydia. They had one last Saturday, but only one of her friends came. Sadzors :(\n\nIt will be a super fun weekend!!\n\nYay for birthdays but boo that only one friend showed up last weekend :(. Super bummer!!  We should get her something fun to celebrate. How old is she now?  I'll swing by my parents while I'm out shopping and pick up or make a card. And we can pick a fun and quirky gift :)\n\nShe's 10!\n\nAh, double digits!!  That's a super exciting birthday!\n\nI had my first teacher email and request me for a job today!!  Unfortunately I am already booked for the date but still... Awesome!!!  :)\n\nThat's awesome!!! You're in demand!\n\nYeah!  It feels good :)\n\nI love you\n\nI love you too!\n\nAnd I'm missing the hell out of you! 😊\n\nI get to see you tomorrow, right? ;)\n\nMost definitely!!  :)\n\nI have Halloween errands and grocery shopping to do but that's all. My offer to walk Remi still stands too :)\n\nOooh... You don't think it would interrupt your day?\n\nNot at all!  There's no parking in my street tomorrow from 7 am- 5 pm for lead cleaning so I need to be up and at 'em early. I'm going to grab or make a card for Lydia at my mom's but that would be the thing that takes the longest ( if I can't find a perfect one and make it instead). Otherwise I can be back in our hood to let him out by 1 or 2. Just leave your keys with the concierge and it's a done deal my love :)\n\nOkay :)\n\nHow long do you wanna walk him?\n\nI'm readying his Kong so I just need to know\n\nThat will depend on the weather.  I'm planning on taking him to the dog park if it's not raining. :).\n\nOkay cool !\n\n😊\n\nHow's your webpage progress going tonight?\n\nJust starting now that I got the Kongs done. Have to do that for shorter than I'd hoped, cuz of how little I feel I got done at work\n\n:(\n\nAt least you're getting you're getting to work on it for a little bit. I think that's awesome! :)\n\nM gonna watch tremors 5 while I work\n\nSee how awful it is\n\nHaha!  Good choice. I haven't seen beyond tremors 1\n\nWe'll have to fix that, because of you haven't seen Tremors 2, you're not a real human\n\nHaha. Deal!! ;)\n\nOnly if I can get you to watch Rob Zombie's take on the Halloween franchise 😉\n\nThey're more tame than his own original horror films, which I love but live you bear no interest in seeing.\n\nSure!!\n\nThough I wish you'd give them a chance because he's an amazing director who fully and incredibly understands the horror genre. :)\n\nI'll take the \"sure\" on his Halloween!!  Yay!!  You won't regret it :)\n\nI'm \"sure\" I won't\n\nYUKUUKYUK\n\nAnd I think it's neat that he's cast his wife in everything his done ( from music videos to films ) as soon as they started dating. It's a horror love story. Haha.\n\n* he's\n\nA horror love story of violent murder\n\nI s'pose so. With funny Star Wars quips mixed in.   And the terror of terrible people stalking the innocent in the cell phone free world of the 1970's\n\nAgain, brilliant director with a unique take on a famous franchise. I won't recommend any film other than those\n\nI like horror movies!\n\n:)\n\nSo, back to another topic. Is there anything I should keep an eye out for for Lydia when I'm shopping tomorrow?\n\nBecky says she probably wants cash\n\nAh, ok. :)\n\nHow's your night going?\n\nIt's going well 😊 yours?\n\nI do think I'm gonna hit the hay though. I already dozed off before 11, lol.\n\nOkay, I should go to bed soon too\n\nI love you :)\n\nSweet dreams my darling. I love you so much Brian!  I can't wait to kiss those amazing lips of yours again tomorrow!! 😊\n\nGnight baby girl!\niMessage with 17014910168\n10/27/15, 11:10 AM\n\nHey you! I hope you're having a great day so far. I love you, Beautiful!\n\nThanks hon. It's been a really nice day so far :). I hope yours has been lovely as well. I love you too!! 😊\n10/27/15, 2:56 PM\n\n\nIMG_3854\n\n\nDoggie parkour\n\nAwww!!  He's so athletic :). That's a great picture\n10/27/15, 4:41 PM\n\n\nIMG_2241\n\n\nIn preparation for the weekend festivities... A few things we may need/want ;)\n\nNice! When do we get these things?\n\nSarah expressed an interest in going to the brewery crawl\n\nAnd I'm wondering if other people at work would want to go\n\nSweet!!!  That would be great!  And if we go we have an excuse to be in our costumes and celebrate all day. ;)\n\nWe could get movie supplies Friday night before hunkering down to some Nightmare Before Christmas and other such seasonal flicks.\n\nDepending on what Becky says\n\nOh yes, I forgot we were discussing getting together. Have you had a chance to talk to her?\n\nYep but no answer\n\nAh.\n\n\nIMG_5461\n\n\nHere's how it looks so far. It could also double as a take on Wednesday Addams.\n\nWoah, awesome!!\n\nThanks hon :)\n\nHow's your evening?\n\nIt's good. At the dog park. In the rain. Cuz I'm good to my dog dammit! Lol\n\nYours?\n\nYou're such a good Remi human!  I bet he's loving it though :)\n\nMy night has been nice. Worked on Halloween costuming, made dinner and such\n\nSounds nice. You obviously got a lot done on your costume!\n\nBecky's down for a Friday night party\n\nI'm now watching Jurassic World and doing a mood board for my Jim Frankenstein site m\n\nYay for Friday. :)\n\nIt sounds like you're having a terrific and productive evening :)\n\nIt's not bad :)\n\n☺️\n10/27/15, 8:56 PM\n\nWe should make gingerdead men for the weekend. 👻\n\nZambie breadsmen?\n\nYuppers. :)\n\nWith bloodies?\n\nYes!!\n\nI'm being annoying to Remi and he's just sitting there taking it\n\nHaha!!  What are you doing to him?\n\nMaking weird noises and poking my nose into his face\n\nNow you have to take it when he does that to you 😉\n\nHe did last night. Kept flipping out and kicking me\n\nThen, when I fell asleep, he moved into his kennel\n\nSo tonight you get him back. Haha!  That silly, sweet pup\n\nYou're silly and sweet\n\nAnd I love you\n\nAww shucks. ☺️\n\nThough you know I think you're equally silly and sweet. I love you too handsome!\n\n:D\n\nWas Jurassic World just as epic and amazing as you remembered?\n\nI like when the raptor rides the trex\n\nHaha!  Yes. The whole trex/ raptor dynamic was cool\n\nAlright babe, I'm gonna hit the bed\n\nGnight, I love you :)\n\nI was just about to say the same thing!  Great minds think alike. :)\n\nSleep well darling and sweet dreams!!  I love you too Brian!! 😊\niMessage with 17014910168\n10/23/15, 4:43 PM\n\nYay. Service again. Haha. How's your day?\n\nIt's not bad. Just had diversity training at work. Learned about genders and sexes and stuff\n\nYours?\n\nWould you be okay if I saw Goosebumps with James tonight? We can't go golfing, but I still wanna have guys' night\n\nI ask because I know you wanted to see it\n\nOh of course!!  Go ahead!  If it's awesome we can still see it later :). Have fun!!  Do you still want me to watch Remi?\n\nBy that I mean of course I don't mind. :)\n\nThanks babe :)\n\nYou don't have to watch him necessarily, but a walk would be awesome.\n\nOk. Do you want to leave your apt key with the front desk?  That'd be easiest. Did you still want me to stay and hang with him while you're gone and stay the night?\n\nOkay yeah I can do that\n\nCool. :). Did you want me to stay?  Otherwise I will give the desk back your key. :)\n\nStay. Always stay\n\n:)\n\nCool. I need to do laundry and then I'll come by and walk the pup\n\nIf it's easier or helps you at all, you're of course welcome to launder here\n\nThat would work well too. Thanks babe! :)\n\nI'll just get my things packed for the weekend and eat some food\n\nJeff will be here, so just come on up. I just let Remi out at 6:15, so he's good for a while :)\n\nSounds good :). Still leaving the key at the desk?\n\nNope, no need\n\nKk\n10/23/15, 8:13 PM\n\nHow's everything going?\n\nSo far so good. :)\n\nHow was the movie. Did you get goosebumps? 🤗\n\nAt 9:30. Got done with minigolf\n\nOh nice!  I'm glad you were able to play despite the rain :)\n\nWell, we're at the mall\n\nThey've got a musical medley going on tonight, apparently. They did Thriller, Time Warp, Ghostbusters, Beetlejuice, and the Bowie spell song from Labrynth, plus many others\n\nAwesome!  That's so cool. At the MOA?\n\nYeah!\n\nRemi has been enjoying barking and howling at every human and noise he hears in the hall. Eesh ka bibble.\n\nWhat a sucker! He's wasting his talkies that he could be using on treats\n\nHaha!  Right. Silly pooch\n\nThe dryer is drowning out the sounds in the hall so he's calming down\n10/23/15, 11:33 PM\n\nOn my way!\niMessage with 17014910168\n10/12/15, 9:17 AM\n\n\nIMG_3824\n\n\nWhat have we done?\n\nOh no!!!  He's a bed dog now. Silly puppy. :)\n\nHe's so adorable though. Maybe he thinks that his cuteness will win over the humans.\n\nIt's true. If you look closely, you'll see he's got one eye open\n\nHe's making sure I'm aww-ing\n\nHe's definitely keeping his eye on you :). I'm aww-ing myself over here. Haha\n10/12/15, 2:06 PM\n\n\nIMG_3829.MOV\n\n\nSo he did this today. He's a living motivational poster\n\nYay Remi!  That's awesome!!\n10/12/15, 6:17 PM\n\nHow's your evening going love?\n\nNot bad, got done with work, played with Remi, now I'm off to New Hope for shooting\n\nYou?\n\nOh fun!  That sounds like a good time :)\n\nI'm just wrapping up post weekend laundry and did some cleaning. Debating on starting a project. :)\n\nWhat project?\n\nJust some old craft projects I started and never finished, haha\n\nI've got some knitting and needle point to choose between at the moment\n\nI wanna see!\n\nBoo!  I'll have to work on it and show you later. I thought I packed all that stuff but I can't find it anywhere, I must've left it at my parent's. I'll get it when I go there tomorrow :) I love the needlepoint because I work on it and watch tv at the same time. I nice and relaxing activity :)\n10/12/15, 9:01 PM\n\nHow was/ shooting?  Kill any paper person who thou roughly deserved it? ;)\n\n* thoroughly\n\nIt was fun, I didn't buy much ammo and the box was short a few rounds, but I shot a pretty tight group\n\nHow was your craft evening?\n\nHow was school?\niMessage with 17014910168\n9/24/15, 10:46 PM\n\nOh man!  Has he been acting funny otherwise?\n\nYeah, yeah it does\n\nRight on the shoe....\n\nIdk, he's tired from playing\n\nThat could be part of it I suppose. :/ I feel so badly that he peed everywhere.\n\nMaybe he's feeling anxious or stressed about something. P\n\nYeah there's a lot going on right now. I think he just couldn't hold it the first time\n\nIdk about the second time. He started in the kitchen again, and wandered over to the shoe, where he had peed the first time\n\nSo he probably just didn't k ow what to do\n\nDid everything get soaked in natures miracle the first time around?\n\nYeah but maybe not well enough. Thing is, now I have to wash the shoes, which means noise\n\nHopefully he doesn't get too excited by it\n\nI hope so too\n\nHow was your night\n\nDone packing?\n\nGuess so :P\n9/25/15, 1:38 AM\n\nOh goodness!  I totally conked out!!  My night was pretty good overall and pretty much all done packing. I love you and I hope you wake well rested!!  😘\n9/25/15, 9:05 AM\n\nSo, my mom just texted me and said she'd gotten to work early and said she'd be happy to drive us all glasses or no glasses. What are your thoughts on that?  I love you and I hope you have a terrific day!!\n\nI love you too! If she's up for it and can be there at 5, I'm down for that\n\nCool. I'll let her know\n9/25/15, 11:05 AM\n\nKk. She's gonna be there by five and we all get to save our leggies some walking\n\nCool cool. Did your glasses come in?\n\nI haven't heard. I hope so!!\n9/25/15, 12:45 PM\n\nI'm starting to get the vacation buzz going. You?\n\nThat sounds like I'm drinking... I mean I'm starting to get excited for vacation\n9/25/15, 2:13 PM\n\nHaha. I know what you mean!  Although, the vacation \"buzz\" won't be so bad either ;)\n\nJeff may or may not be riding with us to the airport. They're \"fucking them over\" on a project so he may have to stay later and train it down alone\n\nOh no!!!  That's really shitty. He won't have to work too late will he?\n\nNo, I think he'll be fine\n9/25/15, 3:53 PM\n\nHa!  My mom just texted saying she's leaving work\n\nMy mom just got here\n\nWe're heading up to your place now\n\nMe too\n\nCoolio\n9/26/15, 10:44 AM\n\n413?  Cuz it's not working\n\nMm\n\nYeah that's the number\n\nThe key was just being difficult.\n9/27/15, 9:16 PM\n\nHey Jeff. We lost you in the crowd but we'll meet you over by the big pillar out front. :)\n9/28/15, 9:02 PM\n\nI stopped at the coffee bean for a coffee.  I got you one too\n9/30/15, 11:54 AM\n\n\nIMG_2054\n\n10/2/15, 2:57 PM\n\nI'm on hold.

Ass. Line.\n10/4/15, 6:32 PM\n\nThe gate is downstairs\n\nOoohh okay\n10/5/15, 12:31 PM\n\nHe is wiped. Absolutely wiped\n\nWhen you come, could you please bring that Kong and measuring cup? :)\n\nI will :)\n\nHow excited was puppy to see human?\n\nHe was up on the fence with jumps :)\n\nThey fed him all his meals, but with the combo of no extra Kongs and all the extra playing, he's looking a little bonsey\n\nI'll have to make sure I get him back up to weight\n\nOh wow!  Well, he'll be enjoying some extra peanut butter Kong snacks then  :)\n\nMy laundry is on the dryer and I'm off to get groceries and such. When I get back home I'm going to shower and get ready and then I'll be back over 😊\n\nOk cool\n\n\nIMG_3788\n\n\nI'm just chilling\n10/5/15, 4:08 PM\n\nWhat's the word, Shakespeare?\n\nJust got out of tinge shower.

I love you millions!!! 😊\n\nAlso, for AHS reference... I checked my Netflix and I watched the first 8 episodes. So if you want to keep watching, we can pick up at 9 together. As a thought. 😊\n\nHey babe! Sorry, my phone died. That sounds good, let's do that!\n\nGoodnight beautiful :)\n\nPerfect!  Sleep well handsome! 😊\niMessage with 17014910168\n9/23/15, 10:20 PM\n\nYou got it babe ;)\n9/24/15, 7:56 AM\n\nYou're my favorite human too, you sweet beautiful girl\n9/24/15, 11:33 AM\n\nAww they asked you back already? You're so awesome\n9/24/15, 2:15 PM\n\nNice! Didn't you already have a gig for tomorrow?\n\nNice, nice. Day going okay?\n\nOh yeah, your day is pretty much over, huh?\n\nI forget that :)\n\nHaha for sure, that sounds awesome\n\nHmmmm... no, I think I'm covered. Thanks!\n\nIt's been good. Remi's pooped, so I'm working without much distraction :)\n\nYep! Also, we can check in online tonight so we can save time tomorrow\n\nYeah I'll take care of that tonight\n\nOf course :)\n9/24/15, 6:16 PM\n\nWhere'd you see that\n\nHmmm, we can do that\n\nRemi couldn't wait the two minutes it took me to pee. He pissed all over the kitchen... then walked through the hallway and into my room -- while still pissing -- over my shoes and under my desk\n\nTwo minutes though!!\n\nI was about to walk him\n\nOh yeah. He went under the desk to hide. And finish peeling\n\n*peeing, fuck you autocorrect, don't cover for him\n\nHaha\n\nCohoots?\n\n*cahoots, Google say\n\nHow's packing?\n\nMy quart bag?\n\nOh sure. I don't have one yet, so I'm sure I will\n\nI'm embarrassed because I don't know what 3oz looks like\n\nOh okay. Can you buy me a couple of those bottles?\n\nOkay\n9/24/15, 9:07 PM\n\nAlmost done :)\n\nPerfect! Me too!\n\nHuzzah!!\n\nAll I have for a quart bag is deodorant and a 2oz bottle of hair stuff. Will that fit in the bag you want me to bring?\n\nIt ought to. Can you send a pic just to be sure so I can adjust if needed? :)\n\nI moved my sunscreen to the other bag but I can smoosh it back in where it was before, it fits. :)\n\n\nIMG_6941\n\n\nShould fit perfect. I also have two target bags for any dirty laundry at the end of the trip\n\nOh nice I was gonna bring a bag, I'll let you\n\nAn extra wouldn't hurt :). They smoosh in small, but I can put yours in my suitcase so we have three and you have a little snore space. If you want, that is. :)\n\nWhat is snore space\n\nHaha. It's a mythical space where snores are hidden away.\n\nWill we have a bag to check? I currently have nothing but my one bag\n\nNope, there should be nothing to check\n\nAlso, on the small chance I get my glasses at VE tomorrow... My mom said she has a meeting at work until 4. Factoring in traffic she'd be to my place around 4:45 (if not a bit sooner) so we'd get to your place by 5 or very close to ( again, depending on traffic ) but I will let you know for sure :)\n\nOkay cool\n\nDid you get a chance to chat with Jeff about that potential option?\n\nNot yet\n\nKk. Also, did the air b&b guy get back to you on the bed situation?\n\nYep, it's all good\n\nSo if your mom drives us, I won't need to pick you up, right?\n\nCorrect. It would help a bit time wise on your end. That's my thought anyways. But it's very tentative\n\nCool\n\nJeff is cool with everything\n\nKk. I will let you as soon as I know if that's what's happening :)\n\nMother of fucking Christ he just just pissed right on my god damn shoe\n\nFucking a\n\nYikes!!

I was pooped though, took also a 2 hr nap right after I got home. I forgot how much energy it takes managing so many energetic little humans. Haha!!\n\nHow was your day?\n\nKind of lame. I was super tired. Maybe not as tired as you though :)\n\nYou gonna come by some time tonight or did you just wanna rest?\n\nI would love to come by :). I just need to unwind a bit, eat, & shower. We can chill with a movie or something ;)\n\nSure :)\n\nI have a few chores myself\n\nDo 8:30?\n\nTerrific. :)\n\nIf you'd rather just rest tonight, please do. I just love you and I'd love to see you and let you download a bit :)\n\nI'm on my way love\n\nOkay cool\n9/16/15, 11:23 PM\n\nI'm home.\n\nSleep tight my love :)\n\nI will. Sweet dreams darling. I love you! 😊\niMessage with 17014910168\n9/9/15, 9:05 AM\n\nGood morning, my special girl! You're as lovely as this crisp, fall day :)\n\nAww!  Good morning to you as well darling! I hope you had a terrific night of sleeps. \n\nIt really does feel fantastically fall like outside!! 😊\n\nSuch a nice walk in!\n\nI can imagine! Now let's hope it lasts and then sticks around until at least mid-November. :)\n9/9/15, 11:36 AM\n\nI forgot to say last night, my mom had some little rawhide chew sticks for Remi. :)\n\nD'aww, adorable!\n\n\nIMG_9137\n\n\nThe clouds look so awesome. And threatening of rain :)\n9/9/15, 1:11 PM\n\nOmg yes!\n9/9/15, 4:44 PM\n\nHow's your day going hon?\n\nNot bad. Stopped at a work happy hour for a bit, now I'm headed over to let the puppy out. You?\n\nSounds nice. Where did you happy hour at?  \n\nMy day has been pretty decent. Just got back from target and whole foods so my fridge and pantry is stocked :)\n9/9/15, 6:57 PM\n\nYumm!\n\nWe went to Glueks. Had my first Oktoberfest of the season:)\n\nYum right back atcha!  Surly has theirs out in the stores now. :)\n\nI got new glasses ordered today\n\n\nIMG_1875\n\n\nAww! Hot!\n\nI can't wait to see them :)\n\nThank you!  As I've been over wearing this pair of contacts, you'll be seeing them a lot once I get them. ;)\n\nWhat's your excitement this evening darling?\n\nNothing. I have a couple chores, but I'm taking a breather. I sat n the couch exhausted, and Remi fucking jumped *into* my food\n\nSounds like my night. Minus puppy jumping into my food. You must've been eating something so awesome he couldn't resist! ;)\n\nIt was just Spaghettios\n\nNo more being on the couch unless he's invited and his blanket is up here\n\nThat makes sense\n\nThough, from what I recall, they were Star Wars spaghettios so he knows they're awesome!! :)\n\nBut bad puppy manners.\n\nI'm tired. I don't wanna do stuff and then be sick all day\n\nPity me :(\n\n:(\n\nI'm sorry love!  I wish I could just wrap my arms around you!  \n\nAre you able to help me out Friday and a little bit tomorrow?\n\nOf course I am. :)\n\nJust name it baby!\n\nThanks Emily, it means so much that you help me out\n\nYou're welcome to be here all you want tomorrow, but Ill need you for a couple Remi walks\n\nAnd Brian hugs\n\nI'm always here to help you out, we're a team. That's how we do :)\n\nI'm happy to do that. When do you need me there?  And Brian hugs are a given ;)\n\nAnd if there's anything I can pick up that will help you through the day, just name it!!  \n\nThanks babe :)\n\nThunder!!!\n\nI know!!!!  I was just gonna say. I'm watching the lightening from my bedroom and listening to the upcoming storm!\n\nLove it!! ⚡️⚡️⚡️\n\nHe could use a walk around noon\n\nExcellent. Are you working from home tomorrow or should I get your keys from you at work?\n\nCouple more throughout the day\n\nI'm at home all day\n\nPooing\n\nNo worries. I'm available all day. I have a couple small loads of laundry to do but otherwise I'm completely available. :). And I bought some Miso soup today with you in mind. I'll bring it. Much yummier than chicken broth\n\nIf I can bring a book and my laundry I can hang out with Remi all day while you work. :)\n\nAs long as it has no solids :)\n\nYou're welcome to\n\nYou certainly don't have to\n\nIt does have small tofu bits like at the sushi places. But I have miso paste too and that can be made into a broth that's awesome with zero solids. :)\n\nI did all my chores and errands today so my tomorrow is really, totally open. :). I'll even bring the SurlyFest I bought of beer isn't verboten before your procedure. I was going to save it to try with you anyways :)\n\n*if\n\nSure! Though beer is verboten\n\nCool :). Then I'll just save it 'till it's not :)\n\nRemi ain't scared of no thunder\n\nReally?!?  \n\nThat's great!!!\n\nHe'd a storm lover just like his humans\n\n*he's\n\n:)\n\nI miss you\n\nI miss you too!  I miss falling asleep in your arms and waking to see your face first thing in the morning! 😊\n\nHow's your night?\n\nIt's very chill. I ran my errands, organized my room a bit more. Now I'm kicking it with Netflix. :)\n\nHow's your evening going?\n\nGot your Netflix back?\n\nThat I did :)\n\nI've been exhasperated by the ass faced little antics of this rotten little ass gobbler\n\nNow he's all wet\n\nOh no!!!  I'm sorry to say that your verbiage made me giggle a bit. That sucks though that puppy is being so challenging. How'd he get wet?\n\nAlso, zero Remi stress tomorrow!  He's all mine! 😊\n\nIve been insulting him with vulgarized all night to make myself feel better. It's making me laugh too\n\nI took him out in the rain. He's been farting his ass off all night, but when I let him out all he would do is piss all over himself\n\nLittle shit\n\nHaha!  As long as you're laughing baby!  He's too damn cute to stay mad at. :)\n\nLil' doggy farter.\n\nLittle doggy fart face\n\n🐶\n\nOr rather, 🐶💨\n\nHaha\n\nI have an appointment at 9:30 tomorrow morning. I think I'm gonna hit the hay\n\nSounds good baby. I think I'm going to be following pretty close behind\n\nI love you\n\nI'll shoot you a message when I'm close to your place tomorrow.\n\nOkay sounds good :)\n\nGnight beautiful\n\nSweet dreams my dearest! I love you too!!  To the moon and beyond and back again!!!  G'night handsome!\niMessage with 17014910168\n7/23/15, 1:18 PM\n\nTMNT themed waterski event on the river tonight at 8\n\nAwesome!!!  I have therapy until 8 though. :(. She's seeing me for free tonight\n\nOh okay no worries\n\nHave fun though!  I can't wait to hear about it :)\n\nI'm probably gonna skip it, I'm not sure if it would really be that interesting\n\nAh. It's a fun idea though :). How's your day been?\n7/23/15, 6:26 PM\n\nWell, I hope it's been a great one. :)\n\nIt was pretty good, glad to be done!\n\nNow it's pulling things together and trying to quell this manic feeling I e been having this week\n\nYeah?  I'm sorry it's been a manic week, that sounds rough hon :(\n\nIt's not rough, exactly, just can't settle down, gotta work work work, feeling very behind. Kind of a panic reaction I suppose I get. Haven't quite worked it out yet :s\n\nAh. I gotcha. I can understand that.\n\nI know it won't help with that feeling, but I'm always here for you :)\n\nI know you are :)\n\nI just gotta get organized, that'll help\n\nHow was your day? Therapy soon?\n\nMy day was pretty good. I'm so glad this was the last class session though. I can't sit that long. Haha\n\nYup, I'm just chilling in the waiting room at the moment.\n7/23/15, 8:08 PM\n\nDone? How'd it go?\n\nI am. It was really good. I'm happy she was willing to see me for free and get me set up for out hiatus.\n\nHow's your evening?\n\n:)\n\nJust got back from Target in NE Stocked up cuz I got a 5% off coupon\n\nI gotta walk back to the Minneapolis one cuz the guy squished my bread and I forgot to buy Chappir\n\nOoh, nice on the stocking up and boo and the smushed bread. It's Chappie's bread now, yah? ;)\n\nLol! Yes please Chappie have bread and be my friend\n\n😊\n\nGot a 3-pack of Blomkamp flicks!\n\nI'm guessing Chappie and District 9. What's he 3rd one?\n\nYep, and Elysium\n\nI don't think I've seen that one.\n\nGoogled it. Never saw it but really wanted to\n\nMe either. Let's watch it on Sunday\n\nAnd cuddle up close\n\nThat sounds like a perfect and most lovely plan!!  😊\n\nI love cuddling up close with you\n\nI can't wait to enjoy a nice, chilly fall evening on the balcony with you. The Chappie night was so lovely\n\nIt really was!  One of the so very many memorable and happy moments I've had the pleasure of sharing with you! :). I can't wait to enjoy the crisp autumn air with you!!\n\nCheck out this video on YouTube:\n\nhttp://youtu.be/_RZi6NCuLbQ\n\nAlso, you don't own Jurassic Park until you own this... 😉 haha\n\nLol!!!\n\nI lost it at the raptors in heels\n\nLet's stay at your place this weekend, and I'll bring the Blomkamp trilogy and we can scope it on Sunday\n\nI know!  And the mosquito!!  I couldn't stop laughing.\n\nThat would be lovely. :). I'll dig out my extra fan.\n\nCool ;)\n\nLiterally\n\nHaha!!  I was just gonna add the \"literally\" :)\n\nYou should scope out the new Tame Impala album\n\nThe guitar intro to “The Less I Know the Better”\n\nYeah?  I've heard snippets on The Current and liked what I heard. I'll look that song up and give it a listen.\n\nNoiche\n\nOn Friday September 25, I need you out of work as soon as you humanly can be\n\nFlight is at 8, meaning we need to be at the airport ready to go at 6:30 at the latest\n\nI can try. But like I said, that day was hairy because there are already 2 shipping people off. I can't talk to my boss until Monday when she's back from vacation.\n\nIf nothing else, the best I can do is arrange to work from like 8-5 or something like that and have my bags ready to go at your place the night before. I'll make it work.\n\n😊\n\nWhat's the return flight situation and timing?\n\nI'll forward you the info, but return flight is Sunday the 4th, leaving SF at 5:30pm (their time) and getting into Minneapolis at 11:05pm (our time)\n\nYou may be a bit sleepy on Monday\n\nWhat’s your email, yo?\n\nHaha. That's perfect. I'll be sleepy but that's ok. I tend to stay up late most nights anyways :)\n\nMy email is: emilymariecaruso@yahoo.com\n\nAight, forwarded you flight info\n\nI’ll cover flight costs, you cover our baggage fees.\n\nExcellent. And that's amazing of you babe!  I'll gladly cover baggage costs. I always strive to travel by air with carry ons anyways. Not always possible, but I sure try. Haha. I'll talk with Tanya Monday then and get it all squared away :)\n\nK, I got the info. :). We should set up a day to plan the trip itinerary. Figure out all the coolness we wanna see :)\n\nFor sure!\n\nAlso, here’s the skinny for next week, while I’m planning shit\n\nMonday is the Sandlot outdoor movie.  Wednesday night is the Fringe thing.  I can do one of those events.\n\nAnd Sunday, we should gander at Fringe shows\n\nAgreed on planning fringe shows Sunday. I'm okay with either of the weekly events. Time wise the movie maaaay be better. Only cuz if hate for us to get to fringe after 7 again and miss a chunk of it\n\nNow, here's the million dollar question... What's your tomorrow night look like?  Do I maybe get to see my favorite human? :)\n\nCuz \"The Room\" is playing for the midnight movie. :). We could walk over, grab a jimmy johns or something and catch the flick.  Also, let's reserve Saturday, August 29 for Rocky Horror!!  They're showing it with a live shadow cast which it awesome!\n\nI'm down for Rocky Horror on the 29th @ midnight. Tomorrow night I could do The Room @ midnight, but I'll need the time before to work if that's cool\n\nI'd be happy to see it with you tho, it would be fun :)\n\nCoolio!  Just let me know a good time to head over. I just saw that it's the weekend for those two this weekend and we've been talking about seeing if for a while. And now I just need to plan my RHPS costume... ;)\n\nCuz dressing up is tres\n\nNeato\n\nYay!\n\nAnd huzzah\n\nYou gonna dress up with me? ;)\n\nYou'd pull off a mean Eddie\n\nI'm not cross dressing, if that's what you're asking ;P\n\nNot at all. Haha\n\nI can try something\n\n\nIMG_1803\n\n\nEddie, the zombie, biker, sax player.\n\nYou'll have to plan it for me tho :)\n\nHaha, done deal. We'll hit the thrift stores and plan it together\n\nHaha nice\n\nI'm figuring a Columbia or Magenta for myself.\n\nLeaning towards Magenta. The maid with the kick ass boots and curly hair. And she's an alien. They're all aliens. Le gasp\n\nShe's got the slutty costume, right? ;)\n\nWell... They're all pretty slutty. Her's is fairly tame\n\nWeeeellll now... maybe she's not the character for you. I mean, she's great, but one with a little less clothing would make for a nice, breezy outfit on a hot night\n\nHaha!  \n\n\nIMG_1804\n\n\nMy two to choose. Magenta on the left. Columbia on the right. Though Columbia was Eddie's girlfriend before Frankenfuter killed him so there's that. I do have the tap shoes\n\nHaha there's so much to learn\n\nI'll educate you before hand. I'll even teach you some of the things to shout at the screen! ;)\n\nSo I spent my night organizing, cleaning, planning, and shopping, and I'm feeling so much better now that I feel organized\n\nThat's great baby!!  Feeling organized is so great, one of the best feelings IMO. :)\n\nIt is!\n\nLots of work to be done this and next week though. I started setting deadlines for my projects again, cuz that's how I got so much done last year\n\nI'm also going to try to stop judging my self worth on what I produce. Start trying to enjoy the learning process more\n\nThat's gonna be very hard for me\n\nDeadline are so helpful!  That's great!  \n\nAnd yes!!! Please stop judging yourself. In my oh so humble opinion, you're amazing!  And one of the great parts of being human is that we DO get to learn new things and develop on older things.\n\nThe learning process isn't always fun, that's for certain. Especially, I think, for people like us who like results and doing a knockout job. But those processes are so very important. You've got this love!  I believe that there is nothing out there that we can't strive for. We may not always get it, but God dammit we get to strive for it!!  You've got me behind you and rooting for you a thousand times over!\n\nI just always want to be the best at the things that I love, and I know I'm not. And it bugs me when I'm not up to my own standards. I get obsessed and anxious about it. I'm not sure where I picked that up, but it's just how I am\n\nBelieve me baby, I am the same way. I talked about some possible roots to that in myself with my therapist tonight. As well as roots to other things.\n\nFinding those roots is hard, but enlightening\n\nI have to say, I've talked about you. And what a light you are in my life, how we talk about things before they escalate to issues and we try to communicate what we need from each other. Point being, you are amazing. We both have problems with perfection that we are dealing with. It's hard, but we have each other, for always. I love those talks we have about these kinds of real world things. Because baby, I'm in this for he long haul, and there's nothing you can say that we can't talk about. I guess I'm saying that you can always lean on me. And I know I can always lean on you\n\nIt really has been.\n\nMake lent be a book to skim through on a needed basis until we can meet again and I think it will be extremely helpful.\n\nDamn, autocorrect got me on that last one.\n\nMy therapist lent me ...\n\nBabe you're so sweet, and I love you\n\nI love you too!!!  :)\n\nHow's your night been?\n\nIt's been really nice. After my appointment I picked up a few groceries at The Wedge. They didn't have in everything I needed but I'll swing back this weekend sometime. Otherwise I've been relaxing and preparing for tomorrow as best I can. Skimming through that book and Netflix.\n\nBut, I'm thinking it's sleep time soon.\n\nSounds like a good night anyway :)\n\nSounds like a good plan. Me too\n\nSleep tight babe, I love you\n\nSo, one more sleep 'till I'm in your arms once again!  Sleep well and sweetest dreams my darling. I love you Brian, to the moon and back again I love you!!  It's you and me against the world, always.\n\n:)\niMessage with 17014910168\n6/17/15, 12:00 AM\n\nYes, bedtime indeed.  I love you too handsome!  I hope your sleeps are sound and your dreams are fantastic!  😊\n\n😊\n6/17/15, 4:15 PM\n\nOoh, feels like a storm is a brewin' outside. :D\n\nThat it does!\n\nIt's been threatening all day\n\nIt has. And I anxiously await some thunder.\n6/17/15, 7:09 PM\n\nI would love thunder tonight\n\nFingers crossed!! 😊\n\nHow's your night going?\n6/17/15, 9:08 PM\n\nBad :(  Had a work happy hour, drank too much, got really depressed for some reason, left early, took a nap, now I feel groggy and crappy\n\nAwww!  Babe, I'm sorry to hear all that  :(. I wish I could just give you a hug and try to help you feel less crappy. Anything you want to talk about?\n\nI don’t think so.  I just got really in my head, then I completely dissociated from the conversation.  Felt like I was floating up above everyone looking down\n\nI can empathize with that. Not a fun feeling at all. My brain tries to run away and own The Emily Show sometimes and I have to tell it to please shut up and let me be. Sorry your feeling blue.\n\nI was just drunk.  I shouldn’t have had that much to drink.  Luckily, no one even noticed\n\nGotcha. That's good. And hugs anyways. :)\n\nThanks hon.\n\nI feel like garbage now.  Headache, stomach ache, dizzy…\n\nWasted three hours of my night so far\n\nWell... If it helps, my night hasn't been super productive either. I discovered oodles of new episodes of Parts Unknown and have therefore proceeded to waste mine with Anthony Bourdain and foods of the world. Haha.\n\nYou know, we could totally waste the rest of the night together. \n\nJust as a thought.\n\nThat would be great, but I’m probably going to bed in an hour or two\n\nThe only reason I’m awake right now is I’m trying to buy some crap online\n\nWell, like I said, 'twas just a thought. 😊\n\nOnline buying anything exciting?\n\nTrying to find parts for a gaming pc.  I’m thinking about building one instead of buying a ps4\n\nOh, wow!  That's kind of, really, awesome!!  Very cool babe!\n\nHow’s your night going?\n\nIt's ok. Just filling out paperwork for tomorrow and Netflix\n\nNothing g to write home about.\n\nWatching about the foods of Copenhagen atm\n\nWhat’s tomorrow again?\n\nMy first therapy appt.\n\nOooh\n\nWhere at?\n\nIt's a place on Lake Street\n\nWhat time is it\n\nAt 6pm\n\nI miss you\n\nI miss you too hon!  Very much so!\n\nI love you\n\nAnd I love you!!  And I wish I could kiss those incredible lips of yours right now\n\nSo Saturday, we should see JW again, then go to Wisconsin.  What do you think?\n\nThat sounds good to me. :)\n\nAlright cool\n\nI just can't wait to get to see you again ;)\n\nIt feels good to have someone who can’t wait to see me\n\n☺️\n\nOf course I can't wait, you're my favorite human!! 😊\n\nYou’re mine too\n\nAnd I love seeing you too\n\nYou've got me on cloud 9 and I don't feel like coming back down anytime soon. Cheesy, but very very true\n\nOh yeah?\n\nOh yeah 😊\n\nI think you have much more faith in me than I do\n\nI’m honored that I make you feel so good\n\nYou're kind, passionate, true, and you love me in return.  I can't ever ask for more than that. You're incredible and yo should believe it dog-gone it 😉\n\nYou make me feel happier than I thought was possible.\n\nSometimes I identify so much with my career that when I feel like I’m falling short, I feel like I’m falling short as a person\n\nI can identify with you there. Career dissatisfaction and anxiety had been huge in my world for nearly the last year. But I can guarantee you that, especially in my book, you're not falling short. And if you struggle remembering that, than remember that I'm always hear for you, loving you exactly as you are, cuz who you are is more fantastic than you may think. Again, gushy and cheesy, but true\n\nThat means a lot\n\nI just don’t feel very fantastic.  Especially when I’m around so many people who are better than I am\n\nComparing is dangerous. I know, I do it all the time. I don't know if it'll help, but when I get in that mind set of \"never gonna be good enough\" I try and stop my brain with affirmations of good things I do have. It helps a little.\n\nI just have such high standards for myself.\n\nI know you do. And I know that can be difficult to bear. But I admire that about you babe. You're drive and passion and ambition inspires me. You have no idea how much.  \n\nIt’s hard to be driven\n\nAt least to be driven and depressed at the same time\n\nAnd, if it makes you feel better, I pulled a total Emily and burned the shit out of my hand on hot glass a little bit ago. Haha.\n\nYeah, I definitely can feel you there. I'm glad to know we can lean on one another in those tough times though.\n\nAww, babe!  How did you do that?\n\nHaha!!  It's hilarious really. I had my \"old books\" candle on my bookshelf burning. It was near the end of its life but somehow managed to set off my smoke detector so I grabbed it to blow it out and the glass was scorching. Haha. Only me. 😉😂\n\nOh no!\n\nYeah. It's feeling better though. Just a silly move on my behalf.\n\nBut, I digress.\n\nI just want you to always know that I think the world of you. You're an amazing human being Brian Reed and I never want you to forget all your lovely qualities. Again, I go back to when you told me you had super powers of awesomeness. You do!  \n\nThose really only apply to burritos\n\nAnd that even failed me the other night 😖\n\nYikes!  But burritos are super delish. Worth all of the potential trouble they cause\n\nAnd the burrito the other night wasn't bad at all silly 😉\n\nI didn’t like it… I like their red curry chicken burrito, but that one wasn’t that\n\nI got something else i think\n\nAh. I liked the flavor. It just had more rice than curry for the first few bites.\n\nAlso, I've been thinking and I think the first dinner we cook should be pot roast. I and my slow cooker make a mean and tasty pot roast\n\nI like pot roast.  Why pot roast?\n\nBecause it's delicious and we can throw it all in the crock pot early afternoon, do other awesome fun things and come home to an awesome dinner that's ready to go. And it's awesome.\n\nI do like awesome things. I'm down for trying it\n\nKiller!!  We begin some pot roast, head out around the city to explore on some nice ride bikes for the day and eat our foods over a flick. A perfect day IMO\n\n😊\n\nWhen should we do that\niMessage with 17014910168\n5/26/15, 11:23 AM\n\nMorning babe. So I had a recruiter ask about PM positions, and I told him I knew someone junior and interested in the field (you). Would you like me to set up a conversation?\n\nGood morning love!  Omg!  Yes!  That would be so amazing :)\n5/26/15, 1:04 PM\n\nOkay cool. Forward me your resume and preferred contact info when you get a chance. However, don't expect anything to come from this, because I've found that working with recruiters often doesn't amount to anything. What I think you could get out of this is a possible chance to interface with someone about the idea of working in software project management. Does that make sense?\n\nWill do. I'll try and get that wrapped up tonight then so I can send it your way :). I think it will just be good to talk about the career field with someone, as you said so it's a great opportunity in that respect. That makes total sense :)\n\nYeah! And you don't have to wait for this guy either. You can always find cool companies on LinkedIn, whether they're hiring or not, and just ping their HR people to ask advice and questions, no goals in mind\n\nTell them you're interested in learning more about PM, and what goes into being a junior or associate PM\n\nGreat ideas!  I've got a few companies I'm interested in. I keep searching their websites too for openings that fit me.\n\nHit them up!\n\nI tried contacting PMs on LinkedIn but my messages wouldn't go through. I'm gonna try via the computer and see if the messages go through that way :)\n5/26/15, 4:19 PM\n\nAre you having a good montuesday?\n\nBeen pretty good. Have my 1-on-1 with my manager now\n\nNice!  I love 1- on-1s. They can be a great and helpful dialogue exchange :)\n5/26/15, 6:49 PM\n\nI really am just crazy about you, you know\n\nI miss you and I can't get enough of you\n\nYou just made me smile from ear to ear!  You're so sweet and amazing!  I'm so crazy about you too and I miss you so much when you're not around!  I love you you wonderful man!\n\nWhat phone carrier do you have\n\nT-mobile\n\nDo you like them?\n\nThey're alright. I had terrible issues with them in Fargo just because they had no towers out in ND but I haven't had any problems here. But the price is right too because I'm on a family plan. :)\n\nThe people I'm on a plan with are leaving, so I'm going to try to get a new plan\n\nAh. Do you want to change carriers or are you hoping to stay with who you currently have?\n\nProbably change. Jeff has T-Mobile and he says it's good\n\nWill you be able to carry your phone over with you?\n\nNo, but I could get an iPhone 6 instead of the plus\n\nAh. Well that will be good then :)\n\nHmm... I want to create 2 vertical lines to divide up the info/ sections of my resume but I can't seem to find a format option for that. Any thoughts?\n\nShare your resume with brian.reed@ave81.com. Give me edit capabilities\n\nCool. :)\n\nHmmm, not seeing an option to add a vertical line. I'm not sure you'd need one tho\n\nNo?  Well I appreciate you looking, I'm glad I wasn't just missing it. Haha\n\nHow's your evening treating ya?\n\nIt's pretty good. Gotta apply for benefits at work\n\nOoh, nice. :). Is it going pretty smoothly so far?\n\nSort of. I'm distracted\n\nAww. That was me earlier. I was forced to shut the netflix down for a bit. Haha. What's got you all distracted?\n\nJeff is back and we're hanging out in the living room\n\nI did order three cards against humanity expansions tho :)\n\nNice. Did he have a nice mini vacay?  And yay for more awesomely fun card fun :)\n\nHe did!\n\nThat's great!  \n\nIt's nice sitting in the living room and hanging out. The room is so conducive to conversation\n\nIt really is. The layout works perfectly for chatting and TV watching :)\n\nAnd my brain is officially shutting down for the night.\n\nHaha that's a good plan at 10:30\n\nIndeed. I'll have to pick it back up tomorrow. That darned formatting always gets me\n\nThat's okay! You'll crush it tomorrow :)\n\nFingers crossed!!  Thanks babe!  \n\nLike, for realsies!

Babe, I'm sorry :(\n\nI was washing clothes and making food and plain forgot\n\n:(\n\nIt's fine. No worries. See ya in a few :)\n\nJust a little bummed I guess cuz I though we'd planned to hang out today since you said you're busy tomorrow and Monday but it's ok. I get ya all next weekend\n\nI thought we were hanging out tomorrow\n\nOh, haha, I must've misheard. I'm sorry.  \n\nI wouldn't be surprised if I was unclear. I'm not sure where my head's at this week. I'm sorry\n\nIt's ok hon. I know you're busy and a bit stressed/ anxious about work. I understand completely.\n\nI know, and hank you for understanding. But I love you and you're important, and I don't want you to feel otherwise. Ever, at all\n\nDo you?\n\nI know that I'm important to you, and I know you love me. I've never questioned it. Not ever. You mean the world to me!!  \n\nGood, because I do, and you are.\n\nI know we're human; we're going to have plenty of moments when we're not feeling cheery or on top of the world and that's ok. I just want you to know that I am honored to be your listening ear, your shoulder, or just be there by your side because I know you'd do and be the same for me. I'm here for you for always\n\nI know you are. And I love you :)\n5/23/15, 6:38 PM\n\nHey babe. I'm leaving now so I can get a coffee. Would you like one as well?\n\nSure!\n\nHot or cold press?  \n\nHothothot, like your butt\n\nKk ;)\n5/23/15, 10:48 PM\n\nOnw\n\nKk\niMessage with 17014910168\n3/30/15, 10:02 AM\n\nHey Beautiful!

Good luck hon! 😊\n3/30/15, 1:50 PM\n\nWell jeez, after this interview, I just feel sick and weird\n\nI really really really don't know what to do\n\nWell, it's just so full on User Experience design, and I'm afraid\n\nAnd I'm still not sure I'm what they're looking for and all the anxiety about the situation is coming back, and I'm not sure if I should keep looking around or wait for this job or take the other one or what\n\nAnd the guy from the other company is pressing me to make a decision\n3/30/15, 3:50 PM\n\nYeah, I'll go\n\nIt's okay. On the level. Just get this inconsolable stomach ache when I get anxious like this. It's hard to focus on much else\n\nI don't feel like it should be like this...\n\nHow's your internationals day going\n3/30/15, 5:17 PM\n\nMust feel good to be getting out so early!\n\nHow often will you be working internationals\n\nWell, I'm gonna try drinking. That's usually good. Watch Better Call Saul\n\nTwo!\n\nThanks babe, I love you and you're so supportive. You don't need to come down or anything, just knowing you love me is a lot :)\n\nThat would be cool\n\nExcellent.\n\nAlso, thanks for introducing me to the awesomeness of Caravan Palace!  They make great studying music!! :)\n\nI know, right? They're great\n\nSuper great!  \n3/30/15, 7:44 PM\n\nSorry babe, Jeff's website blew up and In trying to help him fix it\n\nNo worries hon!  I understand. 😊 That really sucks though!  Hopefully it's not s tough fix!!\n\nK I got one of the issues fixed. He's still got more but he's regimenting out his progress\n\nWell, one fix is still good news. :)\n\nYeah\n\nSo have you seen the Dalek relaxation for humans video?\n\nI haven't\n\nSent it to you on Facebook\n\nIt actually worked for me\n\nBut the alcohol probably helped too\n\nHmm... I'll check it out :)\n\nAnd yes, alcohol does aid somewhat in ones relaxation. Haha!\n\nHaha. Both relaxing and giggle inducing.\n3/30/15, 10:12 PM\n\nWow, Better Call Saul was really good, and I'm super excited for the next one\n\nI love you, and I'm so grateful you're in my life\n\nI'm gonna hit the hay. Sleep tight, hon, and have a great tomorrow\n\nI love you. Good night\niMessage with 17014910168\n3/26/15, 12:16 AM\n\nIt’s a grungy mess\n\nhttps://www.soundtrap.com/play/104130-test-song-1/\n3/26/15, 8:41 AM\n\nI crashed before I saw this but I listened this morning. Grungy maybe but not a mess remotely. It sounds really good! :)\n\nGood grungy though. ;)\n\nThanks babe!\n\nI had a call with LeadPages. In really excited about it and I'm going in to meet the team next Wednesday\n3/26/15, 12:12 PM\n\nHow's your morning going?\n\nNo I moved that to next week\n\nMeetings about what\n\nTell them your goal is to not be working there\n\nI forgot my mouse today, so I have to use a trackpad. My arm isn't used to it so now it hurts. What a stupid problem\n\nIt does.\n\nApparently I have an offer from that company I interviewed at last Thursday\n\nNot sure. He's gonna call at 2 and I'll see what it is. Honestly, I'm not sure I'd be super stoked to work there. We'll see\n3/26/15, 2:33 PM\n\nTalked with the guy. They made me a decent offer. I'm trying to get hold of the woman from today to see if I can't switch my meeting to tomorrow\n\nOkay, she said that should work, she's gonna find a time. What a big day\n3/26/15, 4:34 PM\n\nDay is going by pretty quick, though. How are your meetings?\n3/26/15, 5:47 PM\n\nGo home and get one more drink before beer day! Be sure to drink lots of electrolytes!\n\nYay beer day!! 🍺. I'm just leaving work now and a glass of wine is on the agenda!  Haha.\n\nHow's your evening so far?\n\nJust leaving work myself. Probably going to have a glass of scotch and ponder\n\nNice. 😊. Job pondering?\n\nYeah I guess. I process things very slowly, so I just nee time to kill it all over\n\nMull* not kill\n\nLol\n\nHaha!  Don't kill it!\n\nThat makes sense though, it's a big decision.\n\nLet's start a band!\n\nI'll play the washboard\n\nYes!  I call the spoons!  \n\nYou'll need a whole case of different spoons to use. To Bed Bath and Beyond!!\n\nPost haste!  \n\nMaybe forks too.\n\nHaha \"post haste\". So salad fingers\n\nMaybe some rusty spoons\n\nI didn't even think of that. Haha!  Not rusty spoons- I don't roll that way. You've got the wrong bloke squire!!\n\nLol!\n\nNow say it into a toilet\n\nWhat if I did....?  What then. Does this mean I have to eat my own head?  Cuz eww!\n\nYep. Sorry :s\n\nDamn!  \n\nThe city is so shiny!\n\nGlorious!  😊\n\nSo, what are thoughts for our sober ride tomorrow?\n\nProbably the train. Jeff says the green line goes right to stadium village\n\nAwesome!  That sounds perfect!\n\nHow's the pondering?\n\nGoes well, I guess. I'm honestly just watching tv. I'm tired :/\n\nYou?\n\nTired as well. Today was exhausting!\n\nWhy don't we go... lay down... together ;)\n\nI would love that!  \n\nSomehow though I don't think much resting would be getting done ;)\n\nWhat would be getting done?\n\nLots of the sexy stuff most like\n\nSo... you'd be getting done?\n\nOh, no!!!  We'd BOTH be getting done. 😉\n\nI would love to get you on your knees...\n\nYou would huh?  We can make that happen tomorrow night.\n\nMm, now you've promised\n\nThat I did.\n\nAnd I always deliver on my promises\n\nThat's a long while to wait for you\n\nAlas, I cannot change that fact. Something to look forward to and make tomorrow day better cuz the night will be amazing!  \n\n:)\n\nWhat's good on the tube tonight?\n\nWatching some fan made Fallout series on YouTube\n\nFun!\n\nIt's remarkably well produced\n\nHad some pacing issues but it's really really good\n\nAre there quite a few of them?\n\nWell this one is like, 45 minutes long\n\nI think there's a few more\n\nOh wow!  \n\nOh wow Doug Jones was in it, that's awesome\n\nI knew I recognized him\n\nWho is that?  \n\nYou've seen him in a ton of movies but he's always in crazy costumes. He was Fawn and the eyeball hand monster in Pans Labyrinth\n\nHe's everywhere\n\n\nIMG_1499\n\n\nToday I've been enjoying the pleasures of ne-nettles...\n\nSaw this and instantly thought of Salad Fingers, haha\n\nLol\n\nOh nice!!  I thought there was a vague familiarity to the name. Very cool!! 😊\n\nWhat was the line about the nettles making milk come out of his test\n\nTeat*\n\nHaha!  I don't remember. Something creepy and awkward as heck I bet\n\n\"...and here's a gif of static balloon cat.\" http://imgur.com/gallery/HkmKdEW\n\nHow many lightbulbs does it take to change a lightbulb?\n\n1) that is hilarious and adorable\n\n2) it should only take one if the lightbulb in the human brain is functioning correctly\n\nYou just stole my thunder\n\nNow I'm not telling how many lightbulbs it takes to change a lightbulb\n\nBut your answer was pretty good, let's roll with it\n\nI prefer to think that we are just like minded, haha\n\nBut tell me!  Please, pretty please with some sushi on top\n\nSushi doesn't go with that!\n\nPsshaw!  Sushi goes with everything and you know it\n\n🍱🍣🍚🍣 sushi!!!!!  \n\nI would eat sushi off your naked body\n\nI'd say yes, but then I wouldn't get any. (Sushi that is). Haha\n\nWell of course you could have some :)\n\nBut I can't eat it off my own naked body. I'm not a contortionist. I suppose I need to dust off the old yoga mat and get flexible again. ;)\n\nI'd... like to see that\n\nWhich part of that?\n\nYou contorting to eat sushi off your own body\n\nI'd pay to see a person do that\n\nProbably not much, but I'd pay\n\nHaha!  Well, pay in the withholding of laughter as the spicy tuna rolls off my bum. Cuz it'd be a catastrophe. Deal?\n\nLmao k now this has to happen in sorry\n\nHa! Maybe.... 😉\n\nBefore or after our previously discussed goofy attempt at Rome playing?  \n\n*roll\n\nAutocorrect is trying to make the role playing up for us.

Sleep well and sweet dreams darling!!  I love you to the moon and back! 😊\niMessage with 17014910168\n3/24/15, 10:53 AM\n\nGood luck on your interview, and have a great day! Let me know how it goes\n\nWell, at least you went and you found out some of what you needed to know. And now it's over and you can relax.\n\nWell, post-work\n\nMy day is alright. I have an interview on Thursday that I'm now finding might not be for quite what it was made out to be, and it bummed me out a bit. It seems I always end up feeling underqualified for everything. I wish I could get some kind of positive feedback, or a sign that I'm on the right track or something\n\nI guess I'm just discouraged about my skills. It's creeping back up on me\n\nIt's at Ackmann, the place my coworker was poached from\n\nYeah :(\n3/24/15, 2:22 PM\n\nI will try. It's just a bit disheartening and I have trouble with being disheartened\n\nI asked her to move it to next week so I had a little time to brush up\n\nShe said she would\n\nAh. Well that will be good then. :).\n\nHow's your day? Have you processed your interview any further?\n3/24/15, 6:28 PM\n\nMy day has been pretty decent, besides being awake waaay to early. Haha. \n\nNot really. It could be a great job but I just need to know what the compensation would be if I were to get an offer, especially as they don't offer benefits\n\nYikes... Idk if I'd trust a place that doesn't offer benefits to FT employees\n\nWell, she said it's because they're so small it would cost them an arm and a leg... But yeah...\n\nAnd if they lose their arms and legs, how will they pay for the surgery without health insurance\n\nHaha! Right?!\n\nSo the skyway pimp asked me for money again today, and I was looking at my phone at the time.  I looked up and said, desperately: “My brother’s really sick!”  You know, just cuz I’m tired of dealing with him and now I’m gonna mess with him.\n\nHe was like, “Yo bruddah ain’t sick, I hope he die”\n\nHaha... Skyway pimp. That's kind of a mean response he gave you, stinker!  Cause saying he hopes your brother dies is a sure fire way to get money from you\n\nI know right! He always insults you when you ignore him\n\nIn the immortal words of one ms. Stephanie Tanner, \"how rude\"!  Lol\n\nDone for the evening?\n\nThat I am. :)\n\nWhat have you been up to since you finished\n\nJust about to eat some grub and I've been looking at more roommate ads.\n\nWhat about yourself?\n\nChillin, doing laundry, and studying some PHP\n\nHeard from anyone?\n\nYeah. But they wanted to met potential roomies at 5:15 tonight and I haven't heard back since I asked if they'd be willing to meet up at a later time. Oh well. Haha\n\nSounds like you're having a nice evening. 😃\n\nAww, that's lame. Can you give them a reminder or anything?\n\nI did. I emailed her again this afternoon and nothing. Crickets.\n\nYou don't need no crickets or ghosts for roomies\n\nRight?!?  Well, ghosts would be kinda ok\n\nI would prefer ghosts, but only the dead kind. Not the flaky human kind\n\nDitto. I need a buddy who can haunt my enemies for me\n\nGet him to haunt your boyfriend\n\nBut why would I want my roomie ghost to haunt you?  You're a ghostbuster. You'll kill my roomie.\n\nThat's true. I took an oath.\n\nBusting doesn't kill them, just traps then\n\nThat's true. Haha. Ok. Then I can let my ghost friend haunt you. If you like.\n\nCool, then I’ll release them back into your place\n\nExcellent. We have us a deal then 😉\n\nThere’s a site called CodeAcademy.com where you can learn to code.  In a day, you can get to know a language pretty well.\n\n…fun fact.\n\nThat sounds really neat!! Fun fact indeed :)\n\nI’m excited for Friday\n\nHey, we should have a sober ride\n\nOoh, yes we should. I'm very excited as well. :)\n\nI’ll look at the location/route and see if the train would be a good idea, otherwise we could find a place to walk to to sober up for a while\n\nThose are both good options. We can have a few plans of action in place. Just to be safe.\n\nAny ideas?\n\nI'd have to do some research on what's available and the location.\n\nTCF Bank Stadium, 2009 SE University Ave. Minneapolis, MN 55455\n\nHey, it’s snowing again\n\nIs it?  Is it just as lovely as before?\n\nYeah, just much wetter\n\n\nFullSizeRender-1\n\n\nAmazing!!\n\nPretty, right?\n\nIncredibly pretty. I don't think I could ever tire of that view\n\nSend three more apt emails out. Fingers crossed.\n\nYou’ve been so busy!\n\nJobs and apartments and sex with me.\n\nThat last one is my favorite ☺️\n\nMine too 😉\n\nWell, great minds do think alike don't they.\n\nIndeed\n\nThat means we get to get naked again real soon right?  \n\nOf course!  Hell, I’m naked right now\n\nI’m not I lied\n\nBut now you’re thinking about it\n\nHaha. You tricky trickster you.\n\nAnd yes, yes I am.\n\nAnd also >rawr< 😘\n\n😊\n\nI love you hon\n\nAnd I can’t wait until I get to strip you naked and pin you down again\n\nI’m gonna cash in early tonight and go to bed.  I’ll talk to you tomorrow, lovely!\n\nAnd I can't wait for that either.\n\nSame here. About to crack a good book and get snuggly and snoozy.\n\nI hope you have wonderful sleeps and sweet dreams babe!  I love you so so much Brian! 😊\n\nI love you too 😊\n\nNight!\niMessage with 17014910168\n3/20/15, 10:37 PM\n\n\nIMG_1495\n\n\nI mean...

I love you!!! ☺️\n3/21/15, 11:28 AM\n\nHaha, I guess I beat you there\n\nGuess so. Lol\n\nWhat time is your interview\n\n1:45\n\nYou're gonna do great :)\n\nAnd I'm proud of you and I love you. Those are two true things :)\n\nThree\n\nI forgot the first one I said\n\nThanks baby!  I'm nervous to take my nose ring out though... It's so new and even after months and months they can start closing in 10-15 min\n\nHave to though\n\nDon't worry hon, I'm sure it'll be fine if you put it in again right away\n3/21/15, 1:30 PM\n\nHopefully. I suck at putting those little balls back on. Haha. If you're awesome at it I may need assistance. :)\n\nYou seem pretty good with big balls, but I'll help you out if I can ;)\n\nHaha. The big ones are easier to handle. 😉\n\nHow's your day?  \n\nIt's been nice and slow. I just picked up my room, and I'm gonna let Roomba go nuts in here while I'm out. I moved everything he could choke himself with, so I have high hopes\n3/21/15, 3:22 PM\n\nThat's great!! I can't wait to hear about it!\n\nI'm just starting out toward Target to buy some groceries, then walking home. When can you be here?\n\nMeh, forget groceries. Just swing by when you can\niMessage with 17014910168\n3/20/15, 8:54 AM\n\nlol he knows\n\nNosey lil kitty cat. Haha\n\nThat floral company position seems neat after chatting with the manager.\n\nWhat's the job?\n\nSupply sales. So basically candles, pottery, decorative elements of sorts. Going out and meeting clients and selling ideas/trends\n\nAnd 7-4...? I like those hours\n\nBut now I feel like I need to wait out this teaching job thing\n\nI can understand that\n\nYou always get those weird decisions when looking for jobs\n\nYeah. I suppose I'll just think it over through the weekend and call mpls schools HR and get more details on the meaning of that email and go from there. I can hack vision ease longer if it means I can leave to teach!  😊\n\nThat's true! It would be great to find out more about what the email means and its implications. If a teaching job seems imminent but the timing is indefinite, you can stay at your current place or see if the floral lady would understand your eventual and indefinite plan to teach\n3/20/15, 11:59 AM\n\nSo next Friday I'm working internationals again so I will able to leave at 5 :)\n\nPerfect!\n\nYeah, that worked out well cuz I don't have to use any vacay time. \n\nHow's your day going?  \n3/20/15, 6:25 PM\n\nHold on! Just one more hour till you're free!\n\nHaha!  Even less.

Laundry is on the list and prepping for my teaching interview tomorrow afternoon. I need to do my 2015/16 teaching application too. Ne\n\nNetflix is providing a nice bit of background noise and dinner time entertainment.\n\nSounds nice :)\n\nI keep forgetting that Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg are different people\n\nHaha!  Maybe that's a Hollywood secret.  He's one really versatile actor!  Haha\n\nCould very well be\n\nFor all I know, he's many other actors\n\nI think they're ALL Kevin Bacon.

That will probably be half an hour\n\nWhat's this interview?\n\nFor the upcoming school year in Minneapolis.\n\nI don't remember this one. Have you mentioned it?\n\nwell, the \"Job fair\" is what they called it but it's really an interview. They sent me a time confirmation this afternoon and since I have to apply again for the new school year I want to get a running leap on it :)\n\nWhat do have going on with your Saturday?\n\nNot much. Chores\n\nAnd sleeping in\n\nExciting about your interview!\n\nSleeping in is good!!\n\nSo what time should I be at your place then?\n\nAny time after 4 :)\n\nK.
