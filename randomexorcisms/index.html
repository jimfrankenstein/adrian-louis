"Adrian C. Louis is profane, angry, and in deep love with this sad-ass world. He is the primary reason why I started to write poems. And he is one of the poets that I constantly re-read. He is one of my personal prophets."<br />

"When I hear the name Adrian C. Louis I feel like the ground moves a bit, the shadows we invented in these Americas grow darker, the morning light becomes as real as a needle dropped in a schoolyard. In fact all those things happen when you are lucky enough to be standing in front of art that matters, poems that pull all your organs out and names them like Adam naming the animals. Louis is a poet we can all be afraid of because his truth is our truth and that kind of thing is scary."<br />
